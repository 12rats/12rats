- fun fact: tf2 was in development for 9 years, and its been 7 since jungle inferno (the last majour update). in 3 years, it'll be TF2's 20th anniversary, and also it would've been in hiatus for as long as it has been in development.

there's no hope is there? why do we even pretend like valve is going to care.
